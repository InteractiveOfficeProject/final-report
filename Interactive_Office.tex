\section{Introduction}
% introductory summary to the context

% what is this report about? under what circumstances the project is carried out? 
This report is a summary for the Interactive Office project carried out in the Designing Interactive Systems course at the Department of Computer Science at University of Helsinki during the Spring term of 2017. The report introduces the project ideas, scope, presents its timeline, findings and results.

% what is the goal of this document?
The goal of this document to summarize the utilized methods, identified problems, describe the challenges and findings encountered by the researchers during the project. To make the report easier to read and understand, the chapters to follow are in chronological order similarly to the flow of the project.

\section{Topic selection and research area}
% the context in which the course was started
During the course lectures, several areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related areas were presented and discussed. The course material covered several aspects of research in this area, such as user research, needfinding, prototyping methods and product evaluation. Furthermore, popular areas of research, such as augmented and virtual reality, ubiquitous computing, physiological computing were discussed. 

% what were the original ideas and how the interactive office came to surface?
The topic of Smart Home applications was one of the possible research to dive into, which served as the origin of the present research. Despite the fact that the technology in such application field is studied for a long time already, the solutions are yet limited to the home/living environment. By living environment we mean a setting, where people live either on their own or in a family, perform household-related activities (e.g. cooking, cleaning), spend their free time together and so on. At the same time, Smart Home solutions bring running a household to a new level by introducing interactive, computer-facilitated solutions to enhance energy-efficiency and well-being of families. 

% how does our idea differ, what are the main similarities and differences? 
At the first place our group started thinking, how such solutions could be utilized in a different setting, such as an office or a working environment. Starting from existing Smart Home solutions we could derive several aspects that could be brought into a Smart Office solution, such as: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item energy-efficiency, 
	\item automation of recurring tasks,
	\item well-being of employees in the office,
	\item enhancement of work culture and atmosphere, 
	\item workforce management, workload tracking and optimization,
	\item efficient maintenance of electronic devices and facilities.
\end{itemize}

% why is this research area important? 
Undoubtedly, the above aspects are relevant in numerous places and setting. For example, companies that operate in any field of industry are likely to have an office, where the employees do their everyday job. Naturally, it is in the interest of the corporation to address the aspects listed above to enhance efficiency, quality work and atmosphere. 

\section{Needfinding}
\subsection{Stakeholder analysis}
% under what circumstances the analysis was carried out?
The needfinding began by analyzing the stakeholders of the research. We started to think from the point of view of an IT office environment, because this is an area where our team members had personal experience and interest. However, we did not limit our analysis and extended to other fields, for example banking, law and libraries.

			\label{stakeholder_map}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}

% who are the stakeholders? 
During our analysis, the following stakeholders were identified. The stakeholder map is displayed on Figure \ref{stakeholder_map}. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Employees
	\item Employers
	\item Customers/Visitors
%Potential and existing customers of the firm
%Business partners, investors
%Third parties, e.g. bank representatives, TEKES, …
%Relatives of employees
%Come to visit the office occasionally
%Stay for a short while
%Meetings, Coffee
%Initial information on the structure of the office
%Where to find the meeting room/person (s)he came to meet
%aula to wait for the person if busy
%(AI receptionist?)
	\item Cleaners
%Somebody who is cleaning the office
%One or more
%Once a day/week, …
%(AI cleaning robots)
%Optimal path to clean the office
%(sensors to check consumables?)
%(buttons in every room (green/red) which employees can press to “order” cleaning service) -> mobile app for employees
%Lights on when cleaning starts -> lights off in the room when the cleaning is complete and tables green/red indicators
%Number of ordered cleaners corresponds to the rooms marked as to be cleaned
%(Indoor Navigation?)

	\item IT Department
%People responsible for the maintenance of the (IT) infrastructure of the office
%Their goal is to ensure the functionality of the electronics in the office (e.g. lights, air conditioning, heating, …)
%Sensors to expensive devices to indicate if they’re wearing or not -> in case an error occurs, IT department should be notified where the device is and what the problem is
%Tablet can help to find the way to the device
%(Indoor Navigation?)
%Expensive/Valuable devices should stay in the office

\end{enumerate}

% what are the connections between the stakeholders? 
The stakeholders are connected through the office environment with slightly different needs. For example, a regular employee in the office experiences different means and performs other kinds of tasks than a cleaning lady. Nevertheless, a common purpose is the efficient and precise completion of work-related activities for all parties. Individuals may interact with one another and have to perform tasks collaboratively, together. The infrastructure that is provided by the office may be shared and used by multiple parties. 

Therefore, we concluded that the collaboration, interaction and the proper facilities in the office are essential aspects to carry on with the research. On top of that, the environment has to facilitate efficient work as well as quality outcome of all parties. As a conclusion, we imagined an interactive office environment that facilitates all the aspects and needs covered by the stakeholders above. 

% what was excluded?
On top of the stakeholders listed above and displayed on Figure \ref{stakeholder_map}, other parties were identified. For instance, we were thinking of how the Worker's Union or security companies may benefit from a more interactive office environment, however we concluded that such analysis is out of the scope of our research. Therefore, our focus was moved towards other directions.

\internalappendix{1}{Break habits \& collaboration during work - Interview questions}
\label{appendix:interview_questions}
Before asking the questions below to the interviewee, introduce your and the project?s background. Ask permission from the interviewee, if he/she has 10-15 minutes time to conduct the interview with you. Point out that the interviewee will remain anonymous. If you would like to record the session for further reference and analysis, make sure to ask permission.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please introduce yourself shortly!
\item Tell me about your working field and environment! 
\item Do you think you take enough breaks during your work? 
\item Describe what do you do during your breaks! What do your breaks like? 
\item Do you interact with others during your breaks? 
\item Do you talk about work-related issues during your breaks? 
\item Do you know the professional skillset and hobbies of your colleagues well?
\item What is the standard way to in your organization to get to know the skillset of co-workers? 
\item Do you know whom to contact if you have work-related question? Are these people easy to reach? 
\item What do you do when you are stuck at work? 
\item What could be the reasons if collaboration between colleagues are not fluent/good? 
\end{enumerate}

\internalappendix{2}{Related Work}
\label{appendix:relatex_work}
Studies in real working environments are hard to do: the situation cannot be controlled and the 
study must impact the working people as less as possible. To conduct research, a controlled 
environment is needed. Researchers at the university of Kaiserslautern created the living lab to 
merge these requirements. The living lab is an open space office that was designed with the goal to 
conduct research in the area of Smart Offices \cite{living-lab}.


The living lab has researched different types of technologies. Examples include electrochromatic 
glass which can be turned dark on demand to prevent sunlight from shining trough or personlaized air 
flow optimization for workers. The living lab tests these technologies in simulations and real life 
situations. Another area of research is light and acoustic optimization. Good lighting and acoustics 
cannot be measured directly as most people only notice bad lighting or bad acoustics \cite{living-lab}.
