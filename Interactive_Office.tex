\begin{abstract}
Break habits are essential part of everyday work life. They help us to refresh our brain, renew mentally and physically by putting work-related thoughts and activities apart. Undoubtedly, regular break habits lead to better efficiency of workers, independently from workplace and business area.

The goal of our research is to suggest development possibilities to any office environment. Through literature review, observation and semi structured interviews we identified that regular break habits lead to more effective work and also create a better atmosphere. As a result, relationships between co-workers develop, inhibitions disappear and work-culture gets better. However, some employees may not take breaks regularly or have strong relationships with their colleagues. 

In this study, we identified the need for a tool that helps individuals to take breaks more regularly in a fun and interactive way. We then developed a software solution for this purpose. The software aims to improve regularity of breaks taken in any office environment by matching random colleagues with similar interests and professional background for spending breaks together.

\internalappendix{1}{Break habits \& collaboration during work - Interview questions}
\label{sec:interview-questions}
Before asking the questions below to the interviewee, introduce your and the project?s background. Ask permission from the interviewee, if he/she has 10-15 minutes time to conduct the interview with you. Point out that the interviewee will remain anonymous. If you would like to record the session for further reference and analysis, make sure to ask permission.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please introduce yourself shortly!
\item Tell me about your working field and environment! 
\item Do you think you take enough breaks during your work? 
\item Describe what do you do during your breaks! What do your breaks like? 
\item Do you interact with others during your breaks? 
\item Do you talk about work-related issues during your breaks? 
\item Do you know the professional skillset and hobbies of your colleagues well?
\item What is the standard way to in your organization to get to know the skillset of co-workers? 
\item Do you know whom to contact if you have work-related question? Are these people easy to reach? 
\item What do you do when you are stuck at work? 
\item What could be the reasons if collaboration between colleagues are not fluent/good? 
\end{enumerate}

\internalappendix{2}{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}
Studies in real working environments are hard to do: the situation cannot be controlled and the 
study must impact the working people as less as possible. To conduct research, a controlled 
environment is needed. Researchers at the university of Kaiserslautern created the living lab to 
merge these requirements. The living lab is an open space office that was designed with the goal to 
conduct research in the area of Smart Offices \cite{living-lab}.

The living lab has researched different types of technologies. Examples include electrochromatic 
glass which can be turned dark on demand to prevent sunlight from shining trough or personlaized air 
flow optimization for workers. The living lab tests these technologies in simulations and real life 
situations. Another area of research is light and acoustic optimization. Good lighting and acoustics 
cannot be measured directly as most people only notice bad lighting or bad acoustics \cite{living-lab}.

\internalappendix{3}{Crowdboard invitation}
\begin{quote}
Hi Turkers,

we are three students working on a project for the course "Designing Interactive Systems" at University of Helsinki. The goal of our project to analyze working environments and develop ways to improve well-being and interaction. Part of our vision to reach this goal is to study break habits and facilitate employees towards more social interactions during their breaks. 

To improve on existing ideas and find new ideas, you are invited to join a live design session with our design team and help us to generate ideas. Time and invitation link are listed below.

Time: Thursday, 23rd March 2017, 14:30
Join link: (Insert Link to session here)\todo{remove time and join?}

The Crowdboard is an augmented whiteboard which enables you to help us by adding input directly to the whiteboard - either by commenting on existing ideas or putting new ideas to the board - online, from your personal computer. Because the Crowdboard is still in development and too many comments/ideas would overwhelm us, there will be a limit of 20-30 people that can add comments. 

Thanks in advance,
Jan, Michael, Péter

Your task is help us analyzing the break habits of employees in an office environment and to generate ideas in what ways breaks can lead to better interaction, well-being and collaboration of co-workers. Welcome!
