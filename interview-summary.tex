% what kind of interviews were conducted and why? 
To gain further understanding on the needs and the opinions of the stakeholders, we decided to conduct semi-structured interviews. The reason behind choosing this method of data collection is that it provides fairly large amount of quantitative data in a short time and on low cost. We also realized that through our networks we can reach stakeholders with different background and interest and therefore easily collect data from different business areas. 

The interview questions (Appendix 1) were designed together with the student tutors in one of the exercise sessions. The interviews were conducted on the upcoming weeks before the prototyping began. The transcripts of the interviews are displayed as appendices to this document.
