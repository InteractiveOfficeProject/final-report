# Final Report

This repository contains a report in which our project for the course [Designing Interactive Systems](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/582666/2017/k/k/1)
is documented. It outlines everything we did from identifying the need/a problem to solve to 
actually implementing a prototype.

> *Course Synopsis:* Interactive systems pervade our life in mobile, desktop and embedded applications. 
> The course will give an overview of interaction paradigms: from desktop, to mobile, and to 
> ubiquitous computing. The course will give opportunity to students to develop a state-of-the-art
>  interactive system on one of the topics of the course.
