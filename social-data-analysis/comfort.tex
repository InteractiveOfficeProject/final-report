\subsection{Comfort}\label{sec:comfort}

Modern LEDs provide great ways to improve the worker's productivity by adapting intensity and the color spectrum. It has been shown in recent research that the color spectrum directly influences the activity and biorhythms of people  \cite{living-lab}. \cite{iotagenda} also highlights, how smart lighting can be used to create a more comfortable working environment.

Another important factor of well-being is acoustics. Most open area offices are too quiet and as such talks between colleagues and phone calls distract other people. However, too loud environments are also detrimental to work. Therefore the right balance as to be found \cite{living-lab}. 

Another possibility of the smart and interactive office is the automatic regulation of room temperature based on the time of day. Both \cite{iotagenda} and \cite{living-lab} outline the importance of temperature in the well-being of employees. People expect good thermal regulation in the office and it is also necessary to focus on work. But not everybody does feel temperature the same way. The living lab therefore developed and currently a ``climatic chair'' that helps each individual to regulate his or her working surrounding temperature \cite{living-lab}.
