\section{Conclusion}
The smart and interactive can help to improve the well-being and efficiency of employees in various ways. One need that many of the papers outlined was the well-being of individuals as comfortable employees will deliver better results.

Collaboration and knowledge work can be improved by providing flexible working environments and better ways of communication. While some tools exist in this area, there is still way for improvement. 

Another point is automation: much time is wasted by employees doing things manually that could be supported well by tools, e.g. room management. Many of these tasks may be repetitive and also prevent the employee from doing ``actual work'' -- which in turn provides the chance to remove or simplify these tasks.
